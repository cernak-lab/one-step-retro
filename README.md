- **figure1/**: Enumerative combinatorics analysis of commercial building blocks as one-step synthons for reported drug structures. Includes sketched chord diagrams showing retrosynthetic decomposition and prevalence of bond types in DrugBank compounds.
- **figure2/**: Comparative Venn analysis of shared and disparate core structures of commercially available sp2 and sp3 compounds. Visualizes overlap and differences between building block classes after abstraction of functional handles.
- **figure3/**: Examples of one-step forward syntheses showing drug targets from DrugBank synthesized from commercially available building blocks. Each reaction corresponds to chord pairs shown in Figure 4.
- **figure4/**: Single-step cross coupling maps between DrugBank and purchasable compounds, trellised by synthon building block type and bond formed. Includes Excel data table and Jupyter notebooks for reanalysis and graphic generation. (The raw images/illustrator files are too big to push all to GitHub)
- **figure5/**: Top 25 reactions between building block classes identified in the analysis. Includes reaction histogram visualization with Jupyter notebook showing the most common retrosynthetic disconnections.
- **manuscript/**: Manuscript documents
- **output_datasets/**: Generated Excel datasets for various transformation types (alkyl-alkyl, aryl-aryl, aryl-alkyl cross-couplings)

The algorithm to do this style of retrosynthesis, and used for this analysis, can be found here: https://github.com/cernak-lab/reaction_targeting
